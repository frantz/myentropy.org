# MyEntropy

> Just a small project to experiment with "modern" workflow for building / deploying webapp.

It uses [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) with the official [gulp-webapp generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp) 
and upload built content through sftp.

## ToDo list 

* Add revision to generated content before deployment
* Create a better deployment script with no downtime
* Remove placeholder content
